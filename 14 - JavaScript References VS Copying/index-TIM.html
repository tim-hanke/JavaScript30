      // let age2 = age;

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const players_assign = players;
      console.log(players, players_assign);

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      players_assign[3] = "Larry";

      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      console.log(players, players_assign);

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way - slice() with no arguments will return all the items in the array
      const players_slice = players.slice();
      console.log(`players_slice: ${players_slice}`);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const players_concat = [].concat(players);
      console.log(`players_concat: ${players_concat}`);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const players_spread = [...players];
      console.log(`players_spread: ${players_spread}`);

      // or Array.from()
      const players_from = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update the original players[], players_assign (which is a reference)
      // will change, but the slice(), concat(), spread, and Array.from() copies will not change

      );
      players[3] = "Moe";
      console.log(`players: ${players}`);
      console.log(`players_assign: ${players_assign}`);
      console.log(`players_slice: ${players_slice}`);
      console.log(`players_concat: ${players_concat}`);
      console.log(`players_spread: ${players_spread}`);
      console.log(`players_from: ${players_from}`);

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const person_reference = person;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      // we can use Object.assign()
      const person_Object_assign = Object.assign({}, person, {
        shirt: "green",
      });

      // We now have object ...spread in ES 2018
      const person_spread = { ...person };

      person.name = "Wesley Bossington III";
      person_Object_assign.name = "The Professor";
      person_spread.name = "Ginger";

      console.log(
        "So, an object and a reference change together, because they are really the same object"
      );

      console.log("person_reference", person_reference);
      console.log("But, a new objest created using Object.assign()");

      console.log("Or the spread operator");
      console.log("person_spread", person_spread);
      console.log("Are actually new objects that don't affect the original");

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

        name: "Tim",

      // with both of these methods, nested properties are still references
      const awesome_asign = Object.assign({}, awesome);
      const awesome_spread = { ...awesome };

      // there is a "poor man's deep clone" by converting the whole object to JSON
      // and then immediately converting that JSON back into an object
